\item In Lab 3, you wrangled data from Essentia, Essentia models and LIWC. Rework your 
solution to Lab 3 using \texttt{tidyverse} \citep{tidyverse} instead of base \texttt{R}.
Specifically, rewrite your code for steps 1-4 of task 2 using \texttt{tidyverse} \citep{tidyverse}. 
Make sure to address any issues I noted in your code file, and ensure that your code 
runs in the directory as it is set up.
